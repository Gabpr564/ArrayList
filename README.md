The previous assignment I chose to upload was the one he had for the Object orianted Programming course and it was teh assignment that introduced us to array lists.
The only input there is in the project is just a search for the list of names.
The output should give 3 lists of the same names. The first list includes the names that should be output first.
The second list is the list of names that has been sorted, and the third is the list of names that has been shuffled.
After the outputs, you get the input promnt that asks you to search for a name in the arraylist.
